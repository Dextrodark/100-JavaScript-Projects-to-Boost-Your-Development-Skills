Documentation for Counter Application:

This is a simple counting web application that allows users to increase, decrease, or reset a counter value. It also provides a save, load and clear functionality that uses the browser's local storage to store the counter value. The application consists of a main container that contains a header, counter, and save buttons. The counter element is divided into two sections: the counter value and counter controls.
