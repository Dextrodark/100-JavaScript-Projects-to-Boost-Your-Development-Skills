Calculator Documentation
This is a basic calculator project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

HTML
The HTML code for this calculator contains the basic structure of a web page with the necessary elements. Here are the HTML elements used in this project:

<!DOCTYPE html>: This specifies the type of document as an HTML file.
<html lang="en">: This sets the language of the page to English.
<head>: This contains the metadata for the page such as the title, character set, and viewport settings.
<meta charset="UTF-8">: This specifies the character encoding for the page.
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">: This sets the compatibility mode for Internet Explorer.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: This sets the viewport for the page.
<title>Calculator</title>: This sets the title of the page to "Calculator".
<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet">: This links the CSS stylesheet to the HTML file.
<body>: This contains the content of the page.
The calculator itself is built using the <form> element which contains several <input> elements. The <input> elements are used to create the buttons on the calculator.

CSS
The CSS code for this calculator styles the HTML elements to create a visually appealing design. Here are the CSS properties used in this project:

*: This selects all elements and sets their margin, padding, font-family, and box-sizing properties to specific values.
.container: This styles the container for the calculator by setting its width, height, background, and display properties.
.calculator: This styles the calculator itself by setting its background, padding, and border-radius properties.
.calculator form input: This styles the buttons on the calculator by setting their border, outline, width, height, border-radius, box-shadow, background, font-size, color, and cursor properties.
form .display: This styles the display area for the calculator by setting its display, justify-content, and margin properties.
form .display input: This styles the input field for the display area by setting its text-align, flex, font-size, and box-shadow properties.
JavaScript
The JavaScript code for this calculator contains the necessary functions to perform the basic mathematical operations. Here are the JavaScript functions used in this project:

eval(): This function evaluates a string as a mathematical expression and returns the result.
The JavaScript code is linked to the HTML file using the <script> element.

Conclusion
This calculator project is a basic example of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be used to create a functional web application. The documentation provided explains the purpose of each code block and provides insight into how the project works.
