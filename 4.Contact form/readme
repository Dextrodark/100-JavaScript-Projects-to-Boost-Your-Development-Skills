Documentation For Contact Form:

The HTML code is a basic form that collects user information. It has four input fields: name, email, phone, and message. The form also has a button to submit the data entered by the user.

The CSS code defines the styles for the HTML form. It gives the form a background color, sets the width to 90% with a maximum width of 600px, and centers the form within the container. The form input fields and text area have a background color, border-radius, and font size, and are centered within the form. The submit button has a unique color and border-radius.

The JavaScript code is responsible for sending the data to the email. The sendEmail() function is called when the form is submitted. This function sends an email with the information entered in the form to a specified email address.
